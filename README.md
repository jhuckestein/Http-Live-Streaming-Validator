Java Version of my HLS validator

This is the version of HLS from Penn State SWENG861 course.  The versions of the HLS are numbered where the higher numbers indicate later assignments with expanded functionality.  The programs were designed using the Visitor design pattern, and go out on the internet or on the local disk to validate playlist or MasterPlaylist m3u8 files.  The program was created in Eclipse Mars and can run in command line or batch mode.
